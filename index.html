            <h3>My Favorite breed</h3>
            <p>There are many different dog breeds in the world, but if you ask me what is my favorite dog breed, I would say that <b>Border Collie</b> is the only one!<br>And here's a unordered list of reasons that I think Border Collie is the best dog breed in the world: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Smart</li>
                <li>Hard Working</li>
                <li>Active</li>
                <li>Easy to care</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you would like to have a lovely friend, or family depends on your opinion, I will definitely suggest you go check out your local animal shelters to see if there is one for you!</p>
