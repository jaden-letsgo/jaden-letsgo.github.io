                <h3>MeetUp Report</h3>
                <p>The live meeting I attended is about how to build forms that Mobil users will love in web app. The meeting taught how to build user friendly forms in several different factors. First one is accessibility. The main idea is that we should not split the user group we target from the rest of world. Instead, we design the forms in a common way â€” serve for all kind of users and in a very easy and friendly way. The second factor is complexity. The meeting lists several user cases including desktop, tablet, phone and even some non digital things, like physical tremors and distractions. We should also keep in mind for those different user cases when we develop an app. The simple solution for all is to use semantic makeup. Ways are worrying less about ARIA, writing less JavaScript and future proofing your app. The teacher went through some detailed codes, explaining that using type, autocomplete and input mode smartly could make completely different user experience. Some examples are also very common in our daily life. Like when I fill in forms using my personal information, specific input mode on my screen keyboard allows me to save time by just one simple click, and iOS reads my contact info and fills everything for me. Overall the meeting taught me a new thinking way when developing app forms. Above the functionality and code complexity, the user experience is much more important. Developing the forms friendly and easy to use can make things quite different.</p><br>
