                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hey Y'all, my name is J Li. Thanks for visiting my unfinished project. This project is intended to work on assignments for CCSF's CNIT 132 class.<br>From CNIT 132, there are only a handful of things I have learned since the class started not long ago. However, one of the most important I have learned so far is the rule on <b>Specificity</b>. It is still pretty confusing right now, but hopefully I will get a hang of it in the near future.</p><br>

                <h3>My Web Development Path</h3>
                <p> This semester is my first time learning web development as I have little to none knowledge on the logic of web development. My only experience with web development would have to go back to when I had accomplished a Hello World with a text editor back in Middle School years.<br>One of my favorite websites has to be <a href="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <b>Scholar Google</b></a>, this website is the caviar on top of the most amazing website in the world, Google. It narrows your search into finding articles that research worthdy. This website has saved me so much time during my college years.</p><br>

                <h3>Recommended Reading</h3>
                <p>Technology has been endlessly growing as time went on. From this CNIT 132 recommended reading, "A Brief History of Web Development" by Colyn Emery, it briefly outlines the growth of web development. The article drew to an end with the topic of web development in the modern age after the tech crash of 2000-2001 and stated the maintenance of basic interface and structure of web pages within its growth.
