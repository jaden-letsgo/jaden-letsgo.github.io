        <p>
            It had been sometime since my relocation to San Francisco from North Carolina. And with my parents being more than 2000 miles away, it was not an esay decision for me in planning this trip.<br>
            However, the trip was necessary and has to be done done because of my parents' need for me to help them to move.

            My prefered way for long distance traveling has been reconsidered due to the impact of Covid-19. My travel schedule was setted for early April at the early stage of Covid vaccine which crossed traving by airplane off the list.<br>
            By driving was my only method to get myself from the West Coast to the East Coast, and I knew it would not be an easy task.

        <p>
            <b>More Time</b> -
            <br>
            During the trip, time was my biggest enermy. As I started my trip a few hours behind schedule, I was bascially trying to chase the sun for the whole trip.
            Ironically, I was going from West to East as the sun goes from East to West. A day for delay would have been wonderful.

            <b>Learn to Prepare for Rain Ahead</b> -
            <br>
            Mountain weather is aways unpredictable, and I learned my lesson. During my night camping at Guadalupe Mountains, Texas, rain suddently started to pouring down from no where. It was not fun tring to figure out how to lay and tie a piece tarp over the boxes ontop of the car out in the rain at 2:00am in the morning. Have it figured out early or always prepare from rain beforehand.
